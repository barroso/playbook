# Presenters Checklist

### Before the event starts

The presenter should verify:

- [ ] the connection with the AV system (adapter, screen mirroring, resolution, font-size, ...)
- [ ] night shift and notifications are disabled (OS & browsers)
- [ ] energy saving preferences to make sure the display does not shut off too early
- [ ] the font size in Terminal and other tools is optimal

## Disabling notifications

- On the Mac, in the notification center:
  - enable "Do not disturb"
  - disable "Night Shift"

  - no need to do anything in Safari, it's handled by the "Do not disturb" switch in the notification centre.

- in Chrome, [disable notifications](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/3220216?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)
